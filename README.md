Hi, I'm Chris! I'm a skilled C# .NET, HTML, and CSS developer with a passion for creating interactive applications. Just like Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the USS Enterprise, I strive for excellence in every line of code I write, constantly seeking out new challenges and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of software development.

With a strong foundation in C# .NET, HTML, and CSS, I am excited to contribute my skills and creativity to a professional setting. I am dedicated, motivated, and thrive in collaborative team environments. Outside of coding, you might catch me indulging in my love for Star Trek, staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends or seeking to continuously improve my skill set.

Let's connect and discuss how I can bring my passion for software development and my professional skills to contribute to your team's success! I'm excited to embark on my career journey and make a meaningful impact in the industry.
